## Karsam Plan

Karsam is a desktop CNC loosely base on the [openMill instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-a-CNC-mill-with-a-laser-cutter/). Instead of using laser cut acrylic, Karsam uses [Actobotics](https://www.servocity.com/actobotics) aluminium brackets and parts.
This project has a freeCAD file with most of the design. The CAD file also has the bill of materials (BOM) embedded as a spreadsheet.
Although the machine is already built, the work on the CAD file is still work in progress.
